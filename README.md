CSparse3
========

This library packages CSC sparse matrix utilities compiled with numba to native code.

Many functions of the library come from the CSparse project, however this project does not
aim to replicate the latter or extend it, just to provide the functionality needed
in power systems solvers, particularly for GridCal.

The project retains license compatibility with CSparse, being this the LGPL version 3.
